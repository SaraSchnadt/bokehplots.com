Title: About Bokeh

Bokeh is a Python interactive visualization library that targets modern web
browsers for presentation. Its goal is to provide elegant, concise construction
of basic exploratory and advanced custom graphics in the style of D3.js, but
also deliver this capability with high-performance interactivity over very
large or streaming datasets. Bokeh can help anyone who would like to quickly
and easily create interactive plots, dashboards, and data applications.

For more information about the goals and direction of the project, please see

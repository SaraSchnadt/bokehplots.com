Title: About Bokeh

Bokeh is a Python interactive visualization library that targets modern web browsers for presentation. Its goal is to

provide elegant, concise construction of basic exploratory and advanced custom graphics in the style of D3.js, but also 

deliver this capability with high-performance interactivity over very large or streaming datasets. Bokeh can help anyone 

who would like to quickly and easily create interactive plots, dashboards, and data applications.

For more information about the goals and direction of the project, please see the Technical Vision.

To get started quickly, follow the Quickstart.
